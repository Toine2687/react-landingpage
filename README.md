*One of my first react paid project, still learning everyday.*

The goal of this page is to quickly inform the prospect and push him/her to contact the owner of the website.

The SEO has been specifically designed to position the website on the first page of Google for a local search (meta, alt, file sizes, etc).

Layout structure is equally split between real CSS and bootstrap instructions.
It is fully responsible and loads as fast as possible.

## Test it ##

Test it easily after a git clone via :
*npm install*
*npm run dev*

Will appreciate any feedback üòä
